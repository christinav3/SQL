#In this project, I am querying a SQL database which contains multiples tables in order to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, MIN(price) as min_price
FROM JanSales;   
 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY revenue DESC;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue, sum(quantity) as sold
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(cust.acctnum), avg(quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2;

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM FebSales 
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
