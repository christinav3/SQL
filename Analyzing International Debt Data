/* In this project I analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) 
   owed by developing countries across several categories. ook a look at debt owed by countries across the globe. We extracted a few summary statistics 
   from the data and unraveled some interesting facts and figures. */
