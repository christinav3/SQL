# In this project, I used data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years (1920 through 2020) 
# to better understand American baby name tastes.

# 1. Find names that have been given to over 5,000 babies of either sex every year for the 101 years from 1920 through 2020.
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, SUM(num) 
FROM baby_names 
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(year) = 101
ORDER BY SUM(num) DESC;

2. Timeless or trendy?
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, SUM(num), 
CASE
WHEN COUNT(first_name) > 80 THEN 'Classic'
WHEN COUNT(first_name) > 50 THEN 'Semi-classic'
WHEN COUNT(first_name) > 20 THEN 'Semi-trendy'
ELSE 'Trendy' END AS popularity_type
FROM baby_names 
GROUP BY first_name
ORDER BY first_name;
